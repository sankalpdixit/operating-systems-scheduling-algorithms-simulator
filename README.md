CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is in waiting state due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making the maximum utilization of CPU. 

Whenever the CPU becomes idle, it selects another process from the ready queue to run next. To select this process, scheduling algorithm are used.

There are several algorithms to choose from, as well as numerous adjustable parameters for each algorithm.

The algorithms implemented are:
 
  1.First In First Out
  
  2.Shortest Job First
  
  3.Round Robin
